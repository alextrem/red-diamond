# FPGA

The FPGA is the heart of this amplifier. All interfaces to ADCs, AES/EBU and other analog interfaces are managed and controled by this device. A low phase noise oscillator will be used for clocking digital logic and mixed signal devices.

## I2S

[I2S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IÂ²S) is a often used interface standard for audio semiconductors.
The I2S interface shall have following features:

* MSB first data transfer
* Data word length 8, 16, 20, 24 and 32 bits
* AXI-4 interface
* Up to 192 kHz samplerate
* Testmodes like sawtooth, sinus e.g.

### Tasks

Following tasks shall be worked on.
- [x] First I2S code is compiling
- [x] Testbench running
- [ ] Develop more sophisticated testbench
- [ ] AXI-4 interfaceing
- [ ] Implement test modes
- [ ] Define register interface
